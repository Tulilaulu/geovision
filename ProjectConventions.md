## Meetings ##

### Team meets ###
Team meets three times a week at the university and two times a week in irc. Meetings at the university are on mondays, wednesdays and fridays and irc meetings on tuesdays and thursdays. All the meetings start at 12 o'clock unless noted otherwise. If a meet at the university is cancelled, the team meets automatically at irc. In the same manner, if some member of the team can't come to live meeting, he/she should be at irc at 12 o'clock if possible. Meetings at the university normally last about four hours. Daily irc meeting is about 15 minutes long. All the changes made to schedules or meeting places are announced at irc, so that is the best place to check.

### Meetings with the customer ###
There is no standard daily or weekly meeting with the customer. If needed, the customer is contacted at the university or via email.
